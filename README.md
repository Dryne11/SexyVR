# SexyVR

Mod for Sexy Beach Premium Resort that introduces VR capabilities.

## Building SexyVR

SexyVR depends on the [VRGIN.Core](https://github.com/Eusth/VRGIN.Core) library which is included as a submodule. It is therefore important that when you clone the project, you clone it recursively.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Dryne11/SexyVR.git
cd SexyVR
```

After cloning the repo and setting up the submodule, you should be able to compile the project by simply opening the *.sln file and building.
